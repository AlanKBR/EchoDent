# Agenda Hardening Report

Date: 2025-10-25

## Overview
This pass focused on the Agenda module with priorities: automated tests, micro performance improvements (JS/CSS), verification against official docs, and keeping UX and architecture constraints intact (HTMX server-rendered HTML, scoped CSS, no inline JS/CSS, UTC).

## Tests added
- File: `tests/test_agenda_endpoints.py`
  - `/agenda` page render: asserts presence of key containers and no inline assets.
  - `/api/agenda/events`: filters by dentists, include_unassigned, and `q` (title/notes).
  - `/api/agenda/events/search_range`: returns count and min/max bounds.
  - `/api/agenda/holidays/year`: returns list for a year (empty baseline).
  - `/api/agenda/holidays/refresh`: returns 400 when missing token (guardrail).
  - `/api/agenda/dentists`: returns active dentists.

Infra changes:
- `app/__init__.py`: testing override for calendario bind via `ECHO_TEST_CALENDARIO_DB`.
- `tests/conftest.py`: create/drop tables across all binds, plus explicit ensure for calendario tables (CalendarEvent, Holiday). Clean up `ECHO_TEST_CALENDARIO_DB` on teardown. Session-scoped app for speed.
- Fixtures ensure uniqueness:
  - `seed_dentists` deletes any prior test usernames before insert to avoid UNIQUE conflicts.

Status: All tests passing.

## Performance tweaks (JS)
- File: `app/static/agenda/app.js`
  - Replace `setTimeout(..., 10)` overlay/menu positioning with `requestAnimationFrame` to reduce layout thrash.
  - Introduce `onNextFrameOutsideClick(containerEl, handler)` helper to add one-shot outside-click listeners on the next frame. Prevents stacking listeners and avoids immediate close on the initiating click.
  - Apply helper to:
    - New-event popover (select),
    - Event detail popover (eventClick),
    - Context menu (right-click),
    - Settings and Search menus.

No behavior changes; menus/popovers render identically with a more efficient scheduling model.

### Size snapshot (bytes)
- `app/static/agenda/app.js`: 121,752
- `app/static/agenda/calendar-theme.css`: 15,856
- `app/static/agenda/themes/theme-dark.css`: 10,180
- `app/static/agenda/themes/theme-contrast.css`: 952

Note: JS decreased slightly after refactor; CSS unchanged.

## Docs alignment
- FullCalendar v6 (globals build): height `100%`, list/day/week/month/multiMonth; events function with padded month fetch and shared cache; `fixedWeekCount` for mini.
- Bootstrap 5 toasts: using JS API with fallback.
- Flatpickr pt-BR locale; datetime and date modes; `altInput` for user-friendly display.

These match our usage. No external assets added; offline-first preserved.

## Notes and follow-ups
- E2E simulation: With the Flask server running, manually verify:
  - Sidebar dentist filter persistence and empty-filter notice behavior.
  - Search menu flow (query â†’ list view covering results range).
  - Weekends toggle persistence.
  - Holidays highlight in main and mini (requires token to refresh).
- Optional: Add a lightweight Playwright script to click through the above flows in a future iteration.

## Quality gates
- Build/Import: PASS
- Tests: PASS (pytest)
- Lint/Typecheck: N/A (Python lint not enforced here; JS changes comply with project style).
